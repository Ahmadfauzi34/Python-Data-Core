**Section 2: Architectural Decisions (ADR)**

## 2024-05-18 - [⬡ Carbo] - [Modular Dataset Architecture]
**Context:** The user requested to split the `default.yaml` dataset to make it easier to maintain.
**Decision:** I split the monolithic `default.yaml` into several specialized files (`vocab.yaml`, `observations.yaml`, `reasoning_patterns.yaml`, etc.) and placed them into a `fhrr_project/data/datasets/default/` directory.
**Consequences:** The dataset is now modular, improving maintainability and adhering to the multi-file loading capabilities already built into `loader.py`.
